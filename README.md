# MVC Users System

A simple users system built by implementing the Model View Controller architectural pattern. The system contains the basic information about the users, which can be edited at any time.

## Usage

Fill in the form and create new users! Update information about any of the existing users by clicking on the name and filling in the 'Update' form.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
